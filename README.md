## My readme.md

Hello, I'm Methuja, but you can me AquaCobalt, or Aqua. I am a hobby programmer from New Zealand. Much of my work isn't available on GitHub yet (but I plan on moving them here) but I mainly use this platform to contribute to other repositories. I don't have much but here are my stats: (Yes, it's all HTML lol)
